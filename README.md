The repository contains our submission for the 2024 Systems and Methods for Big and Unstructured Data project at Politecnico di Milano.

The project involves querying two distinct datasets to perform an interesting analysis: the first is the letterboxd database, containing huge amounts of movies data, while the second
is a Formula 1 database holding all results from 1950 season onward. The analysis was conducted using Neo4J and MongoDB technologies.
